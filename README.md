Gouda is an ActiveJob adapter used at Cheddar. It requires PostgreSQL and a recent version of Rails.

⚠️ At the moment Gouda is only used internally at Cheddar. We do not provide support for it, nor do we accept
issues or feature requests. This is likely to change in the future.

## Installation

```
$ bundle add gouda
$ bundle install
$ bin/rails g gouda:install
```

## Usage

At the moment the Gouda UI is proprietary, so this gem only provides a "headless" implementation. We expect this to change in the future.
